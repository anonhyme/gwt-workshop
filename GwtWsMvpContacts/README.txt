This is a Gwt sample app using all components of a MVP+EventBus+Command-Pattern architecture.

It is inspired in:
 - The Contacts Application from the article 'Large scale application development and MVP':
   http://code.google.com/intl/es/webtoolkit/articles/mvp-architecture.html
 - The mvp-gwt-adaptation of this application to use gwt-presenter, gwt-dispatch, gin and guice:
   http://code.google.com/p/mvp-gwt-adaptation/
 - The project Apache-Hupa
   http://james.apache.org/hupa

It is prepared to used with maven and eclipse and uses the latest versions of:
 - gwt-presenter
 - gwt-gin
 - gwt-dispatch
 - gwt-guice

One of the interesting points is how to test almost the code with the JVM, which is the main
goal of a Gwt-Mvp application. 
The application test coverage is about 80%.
