NOTE:

To run all tests in Eclipse as normal JUnit tests, you have to add sources folders
to the class path:
 1.- Select the project -> Run As -> JUnit Test. This should fail
 2.- Select the project -> Run As -> Run Configurations -> Class Path -> User Entries 
      -> Advanced -> Add Folders -> Select: src, tests -> Apply -> Run
